23/01/2014  Version 0.2.2
-------------------------
* A message indicating that the file to be compressed is being
scanned has been added so the user does not get desperated when
compressing large files.

* The assembly versions of CRC and checksum have been updated to be
compatible with 64-bit processors.

* The CRC assembly algorithm now compiles flawlessly. Prior to this
change, the compiler might think that the CRC look-up table was not
used and hence it might remove it, provoking an error as a result.

* Compiled on a 64-bit system, the length of the `u32' data type
(defined in tipos.h) was 8 bytes. This bug has been corrected and
now `u32' is always 4 bytes whether in a 32 or 64-bit environment.

* On little endian machines, the checksum was incorrectly stored.
This prevented that machines with different endian could share a
compressed file with a checksum. The header version field has been
marked as 0x11 (interpret it as 1.1) to distinguish the buggy files
from the new ones.

* Corrected some issues related to the progress indicator.
