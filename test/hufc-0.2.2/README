1. Some notes about hufc
------------------------

hufc is a utility to compress or expand files. It is based on Huffman
coding, so don't expect surprising compression ratios. I wrote it for
fun and because I wanted to know how a compressor works in practice.
Doing this was very useful as I could also use hufc for some subjects
when I was studying at university. Names of compressed files will be
the same as before compression, but with the .huf extension.

hufc can use the CRC-16 CCITT algorithm or the IP checksum for error
detection. They both have been implemented in plain C and in assembly
language for the x86 architecture. Read file INSTALL to learn how to
select between C and assembly language.

Files compressed with hufc are not endian dependent, so little and big
endian systems can share them. Anyway, if you plan to use hufc in a big
endian machine, don't forget to read file INSTALL.


2. The `util' directory
-----------------------

Here you can find the following utilities:

* `genccitt.c' - It generates the CRC-16 CCITT lookup table.
* `bench.c'    - You can use it for comparing in speed the C version of
                 CRC and checksum with the corresponding one in assembly.
                 This program is very short and intuitive, so edit the
                 code and run your tests.
* `test.c'     - It computes the CRC and checksum of a byte sequence
                 passed as a command-line argument.

Keep in mind that `bench' and `test' will use C or assembly depending on
hufc. For example, if hufc uses the assembly version of checksum, `bench'
and `test' will also use it. That's why you must configure hufc firstly.

For compilation write in the shell `make genccitt', `make bench' or `make
test', or simply `make' if you want to compile the three programs at the
same time. Other options are:

* `make strip' to strip the programs
* `make cleanobjs' to delete unnecessary files created during compilation
* `make cleanall' to delete all files created during compilation

Happy huffing!
