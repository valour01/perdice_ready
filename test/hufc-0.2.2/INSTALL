1. How to install hufc
----------------------

Compiling and installing hufc is an easy task as you'll see. You should
follow these steps:

* ./configure
* make
* make install

Once installed, type `hufc -h' to see the different command line arguments
of hufc.


2. Tuning your installation
---------------------------

The default installation directory is `/usr/local/bin'. You can change it
by running `./configure --prefix=/yourchoice'.

If you want to use the assembly versions of CRC and checksum, just run
`./configure --enable-x86asm'.

If you are installing hufc in a big endian machine, you must run
`./configure --enable-big-endian'. This is necessary for the
correct operation of the checksum.

THIS SHOULD WORK, BUT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A BIG ENDIAN MACHINE TO
TRY IT OUT.
